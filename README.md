Introduction
Predictive maintenance is a technique used to predict when a machine or component is likely to fail so that maintenance can be performed just in time to prevent unexpected downtime. In this project, we use machine learning algorithms to build a predictive maintenance model for a milling machine.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various features collected from milling machines, such as:

Temperature

Vibration

Pressure

Tool usage time

Machine settings

These features are used to train the predictive maintenance model.

Project Structure
The project repository contains the following files and directories:

Dmt_project.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the code and analysis for the project.

data/: Directory containing the dataset.

models/: Directory where trained models are saved.

results/: Directory where results and visualizations are saved.

README.md: This file.

Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

Usage
To run the project, open Dmt_project.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells. The notebook is organized into the following sections:

Data Preprocessing: Load and preprocess the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze and visualize the data to understand patterns and relationships.

Model Training: Train machine learning models for predictive maintenance.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models.

Results and Visualization: Visualize the results and insights obtained from the models.

Results
The predictive maintenance model successfully identifies potential failures and maintenance needs for the milling machine. The results are visualized in the notebook, showing the accuracy and performance metrics of the model.
